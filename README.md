# FInal-Battle
This program is a small RPG for 1 to 3 players, it is a battle engine with 1 to 2 heroes and 1 to 3 monsters depending on the battle.
Each character has a series of hit points (right now only 1 for debugging purposes). When a character's hit points reach 0, it will be removed from the battle. 
The characters are divided into two parties, Heroes and Monsters. When a Party has no more characters left, the Party loses the game. 
Each battle is a series of rounds, in xhixh every remaining character gets a turn to pick one of several actions.
If there are only 2 players, and if the two players want to both play as heroes, the game utilizes a simple AI to run the monsters' actions.
I'm currently adding an inventory of items, gear and potions.
